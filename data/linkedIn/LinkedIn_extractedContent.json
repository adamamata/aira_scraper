We encourage healthy competition, but never at the expense of others. Everyone has a chance to succeed, and a chance to reap the benefit.... After all, the more talented people we have on board, the more there is to accomplish and reward.\nWe’re frugal, in a prudent way - We’re all for spending, but only when we see it adding value - to our employees, partners, customers, or any other stakeholder. A great workplace isn’t defined by bells and whistles like grand offices and fancy food, but in learning, value and profits that benefit every member of CARS24.\nWe’re in it for the long haul - CARS24 is on a long journey, and we’re not taking any shortcuts.

But what is the big picture that we abide by? What values keep driving us to help our customers drive the vehicle they choose?\nWe trust, and build trust - We work hard to get the customer to trust us, and we do it by placing them first. Whether it’s evaluation, customer protection policies, warranties, or just customer support - we’re there for every customer, every stakeholder. This is the bedrock of everything we do, and we work hard with committed goals and timelines to keep improving.\nWe invest in employees and partners - A natural extension of our first point - A culture of trust and cooperation means that every employee and partner is a crucial part of our ecosystem. We invest in every one of them, and we measure success not only in terms of profits and balance sheets but in the success each employee and partner sees in their professional and personal lives.\nTaking ownership - We don’t believe in a system of micromanagement and constant oversight. We train our employees to take control, and they are the owners of the work they do. This is inculcated from the time we hire to each project that comes their way, and in our mind, this is what defines a great workplace - the number of people willing to take ownership.\nHave high standards. Top high results - Perfection and progress is what we work towards. And once we achieve that, we move the bar higher and higher, so we can keep outdoing ourselves.\nWe’re a meritocracy - We never let exceptional performance go unrewarded. We encourage healthy competition, but never at the expense of others. Everyone has a chance to succeed, and a chance to reap the benefit.... After all, the more talented people we have on board, the more there is to accomplish and reward.\nWe’re frugal, in a prudent way - We’re all for spending, but only when we see it adding value - to our employees, partners, customers, or any other stakeholder. A great workplace isn’t defined by bells and whistles like grand offices and fancy food, but in learning, value and profits that benefit every member of CARS24.\nWe’re in it for the long haul - CARS24 is on a long journey, and we’re not taking any shortcuts. The milestones we pass, like quarterly results and yearly targets are but smaller rewards in our longer and uncompromising drive to the very top, and the success we see in the long term is what keeps us going.\nShow more \nSeniority level\nMid-Senior level\nEmployment type\nFull-time\nJob function\nAnalyst, Strategy/Planning, and Business Development\nIndustries\nMotor Vehicle Manufacturing and Banking\n  \n\nReferrals increase your chances of interviewing at CARS24 by 2x\n\nSee who you know"

Economic insecurity is part of a cycle of disadvantage for women, often caused by discrimination in employment and education. Poverty magnifies this disadvantage by leading to poor health outcomes, limited decision-making power and few opportunities for women to pull themselves out of poverty. Women in many countries do not control key assets such as the family home, property, and decision-making rights on the use of income, further limiting opportunities to break the poverty cycle. As the global economic crisis continues UN Women is looking closely at the ripple effects on women’s lives. In many parts of Asia, women work in backbreaking and unsustainable agriculture for little reward. Moreover, the overseas employment of Asian women in the informal sector, particularly as domestic workers, is an increasing area of concern. Despite their economic and social contribution to both the source and destination countries, women migrant workers are subject to discriminatory practices, human and labour rights violations at every stage of the migration cycle. UN Women is working with governments and communities to address these and other issues of women’s poverty in East and Southeast Asia.\n\nDuties And Responsibilities\n\nDescription of Responsibilities:\n\n\nDesign support to create a quarterly newsletter for women’s economic empowerment in Asia and the Pacific;\nSupport with country offices to create strategic cross-cultural

skills with a multi-cultural team;\nIncrease understanding of UN Women’s work and the UN system;\nGain knowledge and understanding of issues related to Women’s Economic Empowerment;\nBuild and develop

    "content": "Women's Economic Empowerment Communications Intern - Bangkok\nUN Women  Bangkok, Bangkok City, Thailand\n17 hours ago   Be among the first 25 applicants\n  \nSee who UN Women has hired for this role\nApply \nSaveBackground\n\nBackground\n\nUN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.\n\nA key area of concern for UN Women is women’s economic empowerment (WEE) as expressed in UN Women’s Strategic Plan 2022-2025 vision that: Women have income security, decent work, and economic autonomy as well as in the targets and indicators of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 for gender equality and women’s empowerment and of several other SDGs relating to inclusive growth, decent work, ending poverty, and reducing inequality, and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development.\n\nWomen’s Economic Empowerment at UN Women in Asia and the Pacific\n\nWomen represent two thirds of the poor in Asia. Economic insecurity is part of a cycle of disadvantage for women, often caused by discrimination in employment and education. Poverty magnifies this disadvantage by leading to poor health outcomes, limited decision-making power and few opportunities for women to pull themselves out of poverty. Women in many countries do not control key assets such as the family home, property, and decision-making rights on the use of income, further limiting opportunities to break the poverty cycle. As the global economic crisis continues UN Women is looking closely at the ripple effects on women’s lives. In many parts of Asia, women work in backbreaking and unsustainable agriculture for little reward. Moreover, the overseas employment of Asian women in the informal sector, particularly as domestic workers, is an increasing area of concern. Despite their economic and social contribution to both the source and destination countries, women migrant workers are subject to discriminatory practices, human and labour rights violations at every stage of the migration cycle. UN Women is working with governments and communities to address these and other issues of women’s poverty in East and Southeast Asia.\n\nDuties And Responsibilities\n\nDescription of Responsibilities:\n\n\nDesign support to create a quarterly newsletter for women’s economic empowerment in Asia and the Pacific;\nSupport with country offices to create strategic cross-cultural
